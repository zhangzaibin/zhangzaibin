## Hi there 👋
- I am currently an intern at the Shanghai AI Laboratory and a PhD student at Dalian University of Technology.
- My research primarily focuses on **agents**, including LLM-based agents, multimodal agents, and multi-agent systems.
- I am particularly interested in accelerating agent deployment, ensuring safety alignment, and simulating multi-agent systems.
- Feel free to contact me

我现在是上海人工智能实验室的实习生，大连理工大学的博士生。我的研究方向主要集中在智能体领域，包括文本智能体、多模态智能体和多智能体系统。我对智能体的部署加速、安全对齐以及多智能体模拟非常感兴趣，欢迎合作交流。
