🚀 I’m honored to have received the **Outstanding Paper Award at ACL 2024**.

🌍 I led the development of the **OASIS Social Simulation Project**, which has received **over 1.5k stars on GitHub**, and is serving as **a strong foundation for many research works and practical applications around the world**.

I’m deeply passionate about agents – from the theoretical underpinnings to their real-world deployment.
Always open to collaborations and discussions. Feel free to reach out!
